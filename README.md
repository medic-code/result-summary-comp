## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Using BEM methodology for writing CSS. Using styled components in other projects meant I didn't really have to think about the way we structure CSS much as each styling at the component level. It was an opportunity to dive into using BEM. I found it quite nice to work with and made CSS much easier to read.

- I'm not sure I managed to use the modifiers aspect of BEM to its full advantages whilst working on this. There's probably a bit of CSS refactoring I could do in the summary component.

- Gave me an opportunity to think more about semantic HTML - again I'm sure there are improvements I could make.

- I came across using min-height as a way to center vertically using flex box. I felt that a grid approach was abit overkill given that its a one full component page. Using min-height ensured that the flexbox centering worked.

- Having used design systems I had to think more about how to structure CSS in a way that means I don't have to repeat myself. I felt using CSS variables too much was a little overkill given that its just one component, so didn't lean too much into this.

### Continued development

- Using BEM methodology as it still feels a little unfamiliar to use it.
- Accessibility improvements
- Optimisation for speed
- SEO improvements
